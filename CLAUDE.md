# Clawback

Claude Code channel plugin that connects to a hosted Clawback server for webhook delivery and cron scheduling.

## What it does

This plugin is a thin WebSocket client that bridges a remote Clawback server to your local Claude Code session:

- **Receives events** (webhooks + crons) from the server via WebSocket
- **Dispatches one at a time** through a local EventQueue — Claude must call `event_ack` after each
- **Manages crons** by forwarding `cron_create`/`cron_delete`/`cron_list` over WebSocket to the server
- **Auto-reconnects** with exponential backoff if the connection drops
- **Queues acks offline** and flushes them when reconnected

The server (separate repo: [`clawback-server`](https://github.com/clawback-io/clawback-server)) handles webhook ingestion, HMAC verification, cron scheduling, multi-account isolation, and activity logging.

## Setup

### As a plugin (recommended)

1. Install the plugin (once published), or for development:
   ```bash
   claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:clawback
   ```

2. Configure your connection token:
   ```
   /clawback:configure <your_connection_token>
   ```

Get a connection token by authenticating with the hosted server (OAuth flow or dev seed).

### Manual setup (development)

For local development with a local server, create `~/.claude/channels/clawback/config.json`:

```json
{
  "remote": "ws://localhost:3000/ws",
  "connectionToken": "cbt_your_dev_token"
}
```

**Important**: Do NOT use `--channels server:clawback` alongside the dev flag — it causes an allowlist conflict. Use only `--dangerously-load-development-channels`.

## Config

`~/.claude/channels/clawback/config.json` (required):

```json
{
  "remote": "wss://your-server.fly.dev/ws",
  "connectionToken": "cbt_your_token_here"
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `remote` | Yes | WebSocket URL of the Clawback server |
| `connectionToken` | Yes | Connection token from the server (starts with `cbt_`) |
| `dataDir` | No | Local data directory (default: `~/.claude/channels/clawback`) |

## Architecture

```
Clawback Server ←──WebSocket──→ Local Plugin ←──stdio──→ Claude Code
(webhooks, crons,                (EventQueue,             (processes events,
 activity, accounts)              dispatch, ack)            calls tools)
```

### Plugin structure

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Plugin manifest (name, version, keywords)
- `.mcp.json` — MCP server spawn config (used when installed as a plugin)
- `skills/configure/SKILL.md` — `/clawback:configure` skill for token setup

### Source

- `src/index.ts` — Entry point: loads config, creates WS client + MCP server, wires shutdown
- `src/mcp.ts` — MCP server with channel capability, forwards cron tools over WS, sends acks
- `src/queue.ts` — EventQueue: one-at-a-time dispatch with ack, reminder (2min), timeout (5min)
- `src/config.ts` — Loads config from `~/.claude/channels/clawback/config.json`
- `src/ws/client.ts` — WebSocket client with auto-reconnect, heartbeat, offline ack queue
- `src/ws/protocol.ts` — Shared message types (ServerMessage, ClientMessage)

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cron_create` | Create a persistent cron job (schedule + prompt/skill) |
| `cron_delete` | Delete a cron by ID |
| `cron_list` | List all crons |
| `event_ack` | Acknowledge current event (required after each event) |
| `source_create` | Create a webhook source with optional HMAC verification and skill mapping |
| `source_list` | List webhook sources |
| `source_delete` | Delete a webhook source |
| `activity_list` | View recent event processing history |
| `account_info` | Show webhook base URL and connection status |

### Skill mapping

When creating a webhook source with `source_create`, the `skill` parameter maps that source to a skill/prompt. When a webhook arrives, the skill is prepended to the payload:

```
source_create slug="github" type="github" secret="whsec_..." skill="/review"
```

This means any POST to `/webhooks/<id>/github` will be delivered to Claude as `/review` with the webhook payload as context.

## Session routing

When running multiple Claude Code instances, you can route events to specific sessions using session tags.

### Setup

Set the `CLAWBACK_SESSION` env var when starting Claude Code:

```bash
CLAWBACK_SESSION=backend claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:clawback
CLAWBACK_SESSION=frontend claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:clawback
```

### Routing rules

- **Tagged source/cron** → events deliver only to the session matching that tag. If the session isn't connected, events queue until it reconnects.
- **Untagged source/cron** → events deliver only to untagged sessions (broadcast among them).
- **Tagged session** → only receives events targeted to its tag.
- **Untagged session** → only receives untagged events.

### Creating targeted sources and crons

When `CLAWBACK_SESSION` is set, `source_create` and `cron_create` default to targeting the current session. Override with `session` param or omit for broadcast:

```
source_create slug="github" type="github" secret="..." session="backend"
cron_create schedule="0 9 * * *" prompt="/catchup" session="frontend"
```

## Key constraints

- All `meta` values in channel notifications must be `Record<string, string>` — no booleans, numbers, or null
- All logging must go to stderr (stdout is reserved for MCP JSON-RPC protocol)
- Events are dispatched one at a time — Claude must call `event_ack` after each; reminder at 2min, timeout at 5min
- Dependencies: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `croner` (for cron expression validation)
